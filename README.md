# FHE Time Capsule - Project Overview & Use Cases

## üéØ What is FHE Time Capsule?

**FHE Time Capsule** is a decentralized application that allows users to create time-locked encrypted messages on the blockchain. Leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology from Zama's fhEVM, it ensures that messages remain completely private and unreadable‚Äîeven by the creator‚Äîuntil a predetermined unlock time arrives.

Unlike traditional time-lock systems that rely on trusted third parties or centralized servers, FHE Time Capsule provides:
- ‚úÖ **True Privacy**: Messages are encrypted end-to-end using FHE
- ‚úÖ **Trustless**: No intermediaries can access your content
- ‚úÖ **Immutable**: Once created, capsules cannot be modified or deleted
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous**: Smart contracts automatically handle unlock timing
- ‚úÖ **Decentralized**: Stored permanently on the blockchain

## üî¨ How It Works

### Architecture Overview

                      ‚Üì
                 Encrypted Data (FHE)
                      ‚Üì
              Time-Lock Mechanism
                      ‚Üì
            Automatic Unlock & Decrypt
```

### Key Components

1. **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
   - Modern, intuitive user interface
   - Three-step capsule creation process
   - Real-time capsule management and viewing

2. **FHE Encryption Layer**
   - Uses Zama's fhEVM SDK for encryption
   - Encrypts messages client-side before sending
   - Supports computation on encrypted data

3. **Smart Contract (Solidity)**
   - Manages capsule lifecycle (create, view, unlock)
   - Enforces time-lock rules
   - Stores encrypted content on-chain

4. **Blockchain Network**
   - Deployed on Sepolia testnet
   - Provides decentralized, immutable storage
   - Guarantees transparent execution

### Technical Flow

1. **Creation**: User writes a message and sets an unlock time
2. **Encryption**: Message is encrypted using FHE before leaving the browser
3. **Storage**: Encrypted data is stored in the smart contract
4. **Time-Lock**: Contract enforces the unlock time restriction
5. **Unlock**: After the time passes, user can decrypt and view the message
